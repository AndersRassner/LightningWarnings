# Lightning Warnings
This is mostly just an excuse for me to practice Java.

Currently work in progress, meant to be given an area denoted by latitude/longitude and responding with how many lightning strikes have occured inside that area since midnight (the use case is me trying to figure out why my dog is freaking out so looking at any date besides {{today}} isn't needed) and when the latest strike occured.
